# DNA-Count
This app counts the nucleotide composition of query DNA!

I used pandas, streamlit, altair and PIL so in order to make it work you'll need to pip install them.
After you've done that, just open terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file "dna-app.py" and type 'streamlit run dna-app.py'. 
Works only if you're in the same folder as the file "dna-app.py".
